EpiContactTrace 0.11.0
----------------------

BUG FIXES

* Added missing calls to 'R_forceSymbols' and 'R_useDynamicSymbols' in
  the C init function.

EpiContactTrace 0.10.0
---------------------

IMPROVEMENTS

Added the 'maxDistance' argument to the 'Trace' method to stop contact
tracing at 'maxDistance' (inclusive) from the root node.  Default is
‘NULL’ i.e. to not use the 'maxDistance' stop criteria.

EpiContactTrace 0.9.1
---------------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed build failure on the Solaris platform.

EpiContactTrace 0.9.0
---------------------

CHANGES

* Removed Animate method to pass the CRAN checks. Install version
  0.8.8 manually from the archive if that method is required. See
  section 6.3 in 'R Installation and Administration' on how to install
  packages from source.

* Removed dependencies to plyr, R2HTML and Rcpp.

* Removed usage of testthat when testing the package.

* Removed list methods for ContactTrace objects. When calculating
  measures for several roots, the purpose is to use methods that work
  directly on the data.frame with movements.

* Updated maintainer email

* Changed 'Title' field in DESCRIPTION to title case

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

* Improved performance when calculating ShortestPaths on a data.frame
  of movements.

EpiContactTrace 0.8.8
---------------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed failing test case 'Duplicate movements'

* Fixed NOTE not importing 'methods' from R CMD check


EpiContactTrace 0.8.7
---------------------

NOTE

* Changed argument representation to slots in setClass for the two S4
  classes ContactTrace and Contacts. The package now requires R>=3.0.0

EpiContactTrace 0.8.6
---------------------

NOTE

* Plots are not supported in version 0.8.6 since igraph0 has been
  archived. We intend to resolve the issue in a future version.
  Install version 0.8.5 and igraph0 manually from the archive if
  plots are required. See section 6.3 in 'R Installation and
  Administration' on how to install packages from source.

EpiContactTrace 0.8.5
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Updated DESCRIPTION to use Imports instead of Depends for igraph0,
    plyr, R2HTML.

EpiContactTrace 0.8.4
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added method ReportObject to be called from a Sweave report template
  to get the current ContactTrace object.

EpiContactTrace 0.8.3
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* inDays and outDays now returned as integer from NetworkSummary of a
  ContactTrace object.

* Added 'all' to interval argument in Animate to view visualize all
  movements in one image. The default interval argument was changed
  to 'all'.

BUGFIX

* Fixed a bug that was introduced in ver 0.7.6 when performing
  contact tracing.

EpiContactTrace 0.8.2
---------------------

BUGFIX

* Fixed a bug that was introduced in ver 0.7.6 when calculating
  IngoingContactChain and OutgoingContactChain using NetworkSummary.


EpiContactTrace 0.8.0
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Using the the animation and ggmap package, contacts can now be
  visualized and animated.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.6
---------------------

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

* Improved performance when calculating contact chain in C++ code by
  counting the number of visited nodes more efficient.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.5
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Report now uses match.arg to check output format.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.4
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added the parameters inBegin, inEnd, outBegin and outEnd to
  NetworkSummary to allow for different time windows for ingoing and
  outgoing contacts.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.3
---------------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in Report. InDegree were not defined for the S4 class
  Contacts.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.2
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Improved performance in C++ code by using visited nodes more
  efficient

EpiContactTrace 0.7.1
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Updated documentation

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in C++ code not checking tEnd constraint.

* Fixed bug in NetworkSummary when calculating degree.

EpiContactTrace 0.7.0
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* When the methods Trace, NetworkSummary, InDegree, OutDegree,
     IngoingContactChain, OutgoingContactChain are called with the
     arguments movements, root, tEnd and days; the measures are
     calculated for each combination of root, tEnd and days.

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

* Ongoing work to improve performance using Rcpp.

EpiContactTrace 0.6.9
---------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Changed from igraph to igraph0 to handle the update of igraph to 0.6.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug with Report of a list of ContactTrace objects.  Each
  ContactTrace object called Report with missing parameter clean.

EpiContactTrace 0.6.8
---------------------

BUG FIXES

* The html and pdf reports have been corrected. The table displaying
  individual outgoing contacts erronously switched source and
  destination.

  with only outgoing contacts

EpiContactTrace 0.6.0
---------------------
